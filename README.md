# Earthquake_Prediction

This project involves the development of an earthquake prediction system using enhanced XGBoost algorithm. The system uses the latitude, longitude, and height of a place to predict the earthquake on the Richter scale. Additionally, a website has been created using HTML, CSS, and PHP to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the earthquake prediction system.

Installation:

Clone the repository from Github.
Install Python 3.9 on your machine.
Install the necessary Python packages using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".

Evaluation:

The enhanced XGBoost algorithm has been trained and tested on a dataset of earthquake data.
The performance of the model has been evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Website:

The website has been developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP.
The website provides a user-friendly interface for accessing the earthquake prediction system.
The website allows users to input the latitude, longitude, and height of the place and obtain the predicted Richter scale value.
The website also provides information about the earthquake prediction system and its evaluation metrics.
Deployment:

The website can be deployed on a web server with PHP support.
The website can be accessed by users through a web browser.
